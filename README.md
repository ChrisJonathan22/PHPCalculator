To see the page make sure to run a PHP server either by installing PHP on your computer and starting a server like so php -S localhost:3000 . Start the server whilst inside the project folder or you could use MAMP to have access to a server.

Once you have a server running go to localhost:3000 or go to the address that MAMP provides you with.
